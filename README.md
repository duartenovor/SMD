# Smart Medication Dispenser (SMD)

## Problem Statement
Elderly people have the tendency to take some regular medications. Every year, between 7000 and 9000 people die through medication errors which may involve a wrong choice of a medicine, a prescription for the wrong dose, frequency or duration, missing a round of medicines and confusion of the patient. In order to help people who have difficulties in taking their medications, it is proposed to create an Smart Medication Dispenser. This type of device, besides making this task easier, allows patients and family members to have greater confidence and security in their daily lives. The system should be able to provide medicine dosages at the correct times. These data should be managed by a caregiver. From this moment, the device will work autonomously, notifying the people when it's time to take the medicines and warning the caregiver about any problem that may occur such as lack of stock or the intake time is exceeded.

## Project Description
The first thing to consider is who will use the system, that is who will be the target audience. It is relevant to understand that not only the patient but also the caregiver will interact with the product. A good product must satisfy both users. The second thing to consider is that the main target patients are elderly people. It is important to be aware that elderly people may not have the dexterity of younger people and some of them may even feel a certain revulsion at using a new technology. The system have to be the most user friendly and simple as possible. In case of multiple patient use, the SMD should be able to identify in a simple away the patient in order to be able to deliver the medication without mistakes. Another thing to consider is where the product will be used. Probably a large part of elderly people's homes do not have access to the internet. Without a internet connection it will be necessary hardware in order to get the actual local hour. It is also important to mention that for security reasons, data management must be blocked to all users with the exception of the caregiver.
The figure represents the main interactions between the system and the users. The system uses sensors to identify users. A graphical interface is used to interact with both caregiver and patient whereas the sound interface is used to alert patient to take the medicines. In order to make it possible to remove the medicine from the dispenser a motor is used.
